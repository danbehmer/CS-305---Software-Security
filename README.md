# CS-305---Software-Security

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

The client in this case was a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. This client wanted to implemnt and apply the most current and effective software security possible. They were also seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. 


**What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?**

One thing I did in identifying their software security vulnerabilities was take into consideration all areas of security that could be improved. It is imporant to code securely because it helps mitigate the risk associated with the SDLC. Overall, software security adds to a company's well being by ensuring that their products are secure and safe to use, making them a reputable company.


**What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**

The hardest part of this project was figuring out a way to create a checksum and ensuring that it was secure and unique to our data.

**How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?**

One way that I approached the need to increase layers of security was by taking into consideration the vulnerability assessment process flow. This gave me an idea of where security was needed and gave me some ideas of how we could implement that security. This would be the strategy that I would use in the future to assess all vulnerabiliities.


**How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

One way that I checked to see if the checksum was completed was by connecting to the localhost and seeing my uniqe hash value and data displayed. From there, to check new vulnerabilities, I ran a dependency check to ensure that new vulnerabilities were not established.


**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

Ensuring that my code has comments and is well documented, as well as scalable would be helpful for future projects. Ensuring that I am sticking to requirements and other guidelines would be beneficial as well.


**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?**

From this assignement, I would want to showcase my competency in software security, and a base level knowledge of dependency checks and vulnerabilities.
